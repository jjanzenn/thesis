#+title: Brute Force Microfluidic Mixing Graph Solver
#+startup: latexpreview

* Motivation

I conjecture that there is a brute force algorithm that solves the problem of constructing a mixing graph. This is a potential implementation of the algorithm. It reads a series of fractions as command line arguments and returns a mixing graph if there is one or exits with an error otherwise.

* Compiling and running

To get a mixing graph for fractions $\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{8},\frac{3}{8},\frac{3}{4},1$, run
#+begin_src sh
  go run . 1/2 3/8 3/8 3/4 1
#+end_src
